*** CHORD SPOTTER ***

A guitar chord library app.

This single-page-application provides users with detailed details of how guitar chords are constructed, 
means which tones are used to form them. Which spots on the fretboard have to covered to play the chords.

The information is applied to chords of all kind. Major, minor, added 4th, 6th or 7th chords and extensions
like 9, 11, 13 or augmented and diminished values.

chord spotter uses the https://api.uberchord.com/ to fetch the data for each chord which is in return displayed
as a const object containing the information. 

For example the dmin chord.

{
  "strings": "X X 0 2 3 1",
  "fingering": "X X X 2 3 1",
  "chordName": "D,m,,",
  "enharmonicChordName": "D,m,,",
  "voicingID": "9223372036891542527",
  "tones": "D,F,A"
}

There also variations of the chord displayed at the same time for a greater overview of the fretboard.

Now thanks to the vexchord component at https://github.com/0xfe/vexchords, chord spotter provides users
with a visualization of all the chords in the browser translating the data into easily appliable chord digrams.
