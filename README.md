# mike-albrecht-spa-final-project
My final project for the spa module

SCHEDULE

*** Day-01: ***

â€“ Concept Phase: What is the project about? What kind of web application do I want to create?

/*it will be a chord library*/

Basic Questions: what's the scope; basic design and framework, which techniques, components or external structure do I might need

Defining framework and basic design of the application

/*What has been done*/

Repository created, troubleshooting with pushing needs fixing

Basic code structure has been setup, first essential components that can be coded without yet knowing how the page will look like

*** Day-02: ***

/*Getting things done - how to get code running*/

Spend the day with establishing functionality, creating rest of the needed components and starting setting up a css file. 

Quite an uphill battle as fetching functions didn't work ten, fifteen times. Debugging sums up the day. /*That has been done even it took some time.*/ Also, the debugging of the chord diagram logic took forever as the initial state showed the fingering images mirrored and displaced on the fretboard sketch.

*** Day-03: ***

Testing and adjusting the code functionality. Fetching data and visualization of chord diagrams work for the most part. So fetching api from uberchord runs smoothly but there are some chords that may not look that nicely. 

Reduced scope - Favorite Chords will have to wait, the link redirects to home page. CSS file got out of hand. Nice to remember things but SASS might could have shortcut things a bit.

https://github.com/0xfe/vexchords - installed for visualized chord diagrams.
